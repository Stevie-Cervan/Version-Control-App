# Version-Control-App
My code for the Version Control App I made in CodeHS. Was in made react native and with the CodeHS syntax.

Since I am new to GitHub, I had to research different terminology for it. The main focus was Version Control though once we had the questions done we had create an app from scratch in react native.
